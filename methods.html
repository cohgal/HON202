            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>To estimate the current situation as it is perceived by transit users in Portland, focus groups would be formed. To create diverse focus groups, participants will be recruited via verity of ways: advertisements in local papers, flyers on transit, letters sent to riders’ homes (possibly as indicated by TriMet database, if legally allowed to provide information, and if authorized by IRB). They will discuss the following aspects:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessibility, with regards to location of stops and lines, disability accommodations, and service fares.
          <li>Safety, with regards to law enforcement, COVID-19 regulations, and controlled access to the systems (gates / closed stations / open on street level).
            <li>Convenience, with regards to travel time, service frequencies, and accurate schedule and maps.
        </ul>
        <p>
        The participants will initially be presented with a questionnaire to group them with other users with similar needs from the transit system. The initial question will be open, hoping to gather unbiased information: “what makes a system like this useful, relevant, and reliable?” The following questions will include: How often do you use public transportation? Do you own / share / have access to a private vehicle? If you have more than one option of transit service, which one do you use? Why?
        </p>
        <p>
        They will receive compensations for the time they spend in those discussion groups. A research assistant will be present in those discussions, and guide them through open-ended questions, intended to simulate a group discussion. The session will be recorded, after obtaining consent from participants, and later analyzed and coded to uncover themes. The intention of those discussions is to obtain qualitative information about the users’ needs and find themes between them. After the raw data will be analyzed and embedded in the research, all data collected from participants will be archived and encrypted according to the university’s data management standards until publication. At the time of publication, all raw data will be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
        While group discussions don’t guarantee clear and objective results, it is expected that with each participant’s story and/or comment, other participants’ memory will be activated, and those memories and experiences will uncover valuable, relevant information. The goal of these conversations in to learn about the way users feel about the transit system in the metropolitan area, record their stories and experiences in an ethnographic fashion and construct a narrative of user experience from multiple points of view.
        </p>
      <h3>Existing Data</h3>
        <p>
        TriMet usage information is publicly available and can be accessed to collect official statistics about public transportation usage (Ridership and Performance Statistics, n.d.). This data can be later used for analysis and comparison between the official data and the experience perceived by the users, to draw conclusions on the disposition between the system intention, design, and execution.
        </p>
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
        Questionnaires, transcripts from discussion groups, and publicly available data will be organized and coded with ‘accessibility’, ‘safety’, ‘convenience’, ‘integration’, and any other reoccurring themes, discovered during the data collection process. Those initial terms are the result of preliminary conversations with several users of the Portland transit system and review of local academic literature about the system.
        </p>
        <p>
        Uncovering themes of limited reach of service, low frequencies, concerns about safety, and traffic integration problems due to TriMet’s on-street operations will confirm our hypothesis, that the system in Portland is lacking reach to numeral neighborhoods, offers many low frequency lines, and is facing some unique challenges, regarding passengers’ safety and sense of security while waiting to their rides, or onboard.
        </p>
        <p>
        Uncovering themes of passengers’ satisfaction about those issues will disconfirm our hypothesis. With that, it is likely that other concerns will be discovered, and the updated, current data will be valuable in improving the public transportation system in the Portland area. At this point, the data will be evaluated, and further investigation of the concerns will be performed, including reconstruction of data sources. The data and conclusions will be constructed into a report which will return to the community as a proposal for services improvements.
