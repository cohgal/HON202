        <h1 >Public Transportation Research Proposal Project</h1>
        <p>This website includes the content of a research proposal written with the intention to investigate the characteristics of an efficient and ideal public transportation system in the Portland Metro Area and compare it with the existing system. The goal of the project is to increase the usage of public transportation and to reduce the dependance on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p> The work for this proposal was done during the Winter of 2022 as a part of the course HON202: <cite>Honors Urban Humanities</cite> by Gal Cohen. </p>
